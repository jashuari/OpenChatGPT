This is a React component named ChatGPT. It's a chat application that communicates with the GPT-3.5-Turbo model from OpenAI using the OpenAI API. Here's an overview of the component:
1. Imports required dependencies, including React hooks, axios for API calls, CSS files, avatar images, and Prism for code highlighting.
2. Defines ChatGPT functional component with the following features:
    * Stores user messages and AI assistant messages using the useState hook.
    * Stores conversation data in the localStorage and retrieves it when the component is rendered.
    * Utilizes the useTheme hook for managing theme switching.
    * Handles sending a user message and obtaining an AI response using axios.
    * Parses the AI response to highlight code and format content.
    * Implements a typing indicator to display when the AI is generating a response.
    * Supports multiple conversations, switching between conversations, and deleting conversations.
    * Provides a chat reset and delete all conversations feature.
    * Handles user input, including sending messages with 'Enter' and adjusting the textarea size.
    * Implements copy-to-clipboard functionality for code blocks in the chat.

At a high level, the component renders a chat interface where users can type their messages and receive responses from the GPT-3.5-Turbo model. The chat history is stored in the local storage, and the component supports switching between different conversations. Users can also change the theme of the application.

#  Todos

## Back-end:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create an API for the chat application:\
a. Set up an Express.js server.\
b. Create RESTful API endpoints for managing conversations, messages, and users.\
c. Implement API logic to interact with a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).\\

Add database support:\
a. Design a database schema for conversations, messages, and users.\
b. Implement database connection and CRUD operations.\
c. Set up a system for database migrations and versioning.\\

Implement user authentication and authorization:\
a. Add user registration and login endpoints.\
b. Implement JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.\
c. Secure API endpoints with middleware to check for valid JWTs and user permissions.\
d. Encrypt user passwords before storing them in the database.\\

## Front-end:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Refactor the code to improve maintainability:\
a. Separate components into different files.\
b. Organize components in a folder structure based on their purpose.\
c. Replace inline CSS with styled-components or CSS modules.\\

Implement new features:\
a. Add functionality to handle user registration and login.\
b. Update the UI to include forms for user authentication.\
c. Modify API requests to include JWTs for secure communication with the back-end.\

## DevOps:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set up a build and deployment pipeline:\
a. Configure a build system (e.g., Webpack) to compile and bundle the front-end application.\
b. Automate deployment to a hosting service (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Netlify) using CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.\

Configure environment variables and secrets:\
a. Manage API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information using environment variables or a secrets management service.\
b. Set up separate environments for development, staging, and production.\\

Implement monitoring and logging:\
a. Set up monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic or Datadog) to track application performance and resource usage.\
b. Configure logging for the back-end to track errors and other important events.\\

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
