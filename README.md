This is a React component named ChatGPT. It's a chat application that communicates with the GPT-3.5-Turbo model from OpenAI using the OpenAI API. Here's an overview of the component:
1. Imports required dependencies, including React hooks, axios for API calls, CSS files, avatar images, and Prism for code highlighting.
2. Defines ChatGPT functional component with the following features:
    * Stores user messages and AI assistant messages using the useState hook.
    * Stores conversation data in the localStorage and retrieves it when the component is rendered.
    * Utilizes the useTheme hook for managing theme switching.
    * Handles sending a user message and obtaining an AI response using axios.
    * Parses the AI response to highlight code and format content.
    * Implements a typing indicator to display when the AI is generating a response.
    * Supports multiple conversations, switching between conversations, and deleting conversations.
    * Provides a chat reset and delete all conversations feature.
    * Handles user input, including sending messages with 'Enter' and adjusting the textarea size.
    * Implements copy-to-clipboard functionality for code blocks in the chat.

At a high level, the component renders a chat interface where users can type their messages and receive responses from the GPT-3.5-Turbo model. The chat history is stored in the local storage, and the component supports switching between different conversations. Users can also change the theme of the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
